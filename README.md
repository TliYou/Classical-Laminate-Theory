# Classical Laminate Theory

This code was written to complete assigments AA 532 Mechanics of Composite Materials at the University of Washington. It is an application of clasical laminate theory (CLT) for the analysis of composite laminates.

To use it, do:

	from CLTFunctions import *

Then call the functions in CLTFunctions.py. While not necessary, it is expected that the input parameters of a given laminate problem will be provided in a .ini file like problem3.ini.

Enjoy!
